# social-network-api

For this assignment i used the controller js to write out the routes for thoughts, users and reactions.

I used the routes api folders to connect the controllers and their routes to make everything functional.

The models were used to write out the schemas for thoughts, users and reactions.

I used express and mongoose packages to increase my functionality.
